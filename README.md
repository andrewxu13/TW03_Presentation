# Text Classification with SVM and Naive Bayes in Python

This project demonstrates the application of Text Classification using two popular algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes. The code and methodologies are inspired by a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@bedigunjit/simple-guide-to-text-classification-nlp-using-svm-and-naive-bayes-with-python-421db3a72d34) and tailored to provide hands-on experience with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required Python packages:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Notebook

Open the Jupyter Notebook (`NB_vs_SVM_V2.ipynb`) in JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook NB_vs_SVM_V2.ipynb
```

Follow the steps outlined in the notebook, which include:
- Step 1: Installing required packages
- Step 2: Adding the Data using pandas
- Step 3: Data Pre-Processing
- Further steps for model training and evaluation are detailed within the notebook.
